<p>
With global domination of more than 50 years and the inspiration to protect bike lovers and adventure enthusiasts all over the world, Vitality Hi-Tech India Ltd. 
(SBHT) was founded on 13th March 1964. SBHT, a flagship company of Vitality Group of Industries, 
ventured into the unknown territory of auto accessory business to manufacture helmets.<br>
<br>
From humble beginnings come great achievements. Leaving behind the savagery of partition, 
Mr. Jaya Kumar, a man of exceptional business acumen spearheaded his efforts to turn a small 
time family business into a multimillion dollar empire with exports spreading across 50 nations 
like Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, Vietnam, Bahrain, Dubai, Nepal, 
Colombia, Uruguay and other European countries. SBHT has already embarked on real estate business, 
entertainment and is also actively involved in organizing motorsports events on a regular basis.
Excellent quality imparts national and international recognition especially when it comes to 
manufacturing Motor Cycle Helmets with Sweat Resistant Interiors, Pannier Boxes, Helmet Locking 
Devices (HLD) and Auto Accessories, all manufactured with avant-garde technology.<br>
<br>
SBHT specializes as an OEM to top-notch clients as Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Royal Enfield. Customers can now buy SBHT products directly via mobile optimized online store.
SBHT has emerged as the oldest and leading manufacturers of Helmets, Pannier Boxes and Auto 
Accessories in India. It has marked formidable presence across all business 
verticals, national and international alike. It has PAN India distribution 
channel together with presence in 2-tier and 3-tier cities too and sells wide variety of products to government agencies like CSD and CPC as well.
In technical collaboration with global giants like Composites, Bieffe and AD 
Engineering, Italy, SBHT has cutting edge manufacturing facility in all 6 of its 
plants and the largest one is in Baddi (Himachal Pradesh), near Chandigarh with 
over one hundred and fifty thousand Sq. ft. of covered area. SBHT has installed 
capacity of 22000 Helmets per day and 1600 Side Boxes (Pannier Box) per day.
<br>
<br>To achieve this capacity, 
SBHT has deployed a fleet of latest Equipments, Injection Moulding Machines, Automatic Robotic Visor Lines, and Balloon Moulding Machines. 
SBHT has a complete range of 51 Helmet models and 17 Pannier Boxes models, each having 3 to 9 colour variants.
To serve all customer segments, there is a wide variety of Helmets manufactured 
by SBHT in each segment- Open Face, Full Face, Flip-Up Helmets, Flip-Off Helmets, Moto-Cross Helmets, and Carbon Fibre etc. 
Customised Helmets with anti-scratch, anti-glare and anti-fog visors are fitted as per the requirements of individual customer. 
To reach nation-wide potential customers, SBHT has opened RiderZ Shopee.<br>
<br>
SBHT has 4 major brands- Vitality, Ares, Vitality Air & Ignyte. Air Helmet and Ignyte Accessories have been launched very recently. 
Ares is a premium brand of SBHT manufactured in collaboration with OUTLAST, NASA certified technology. Vitality Air is another world 
class brand crafted with revolutionary ventilation system. Ignyte is a compact kit bag of biking accessories. Both Vitality Air and 
Ignyte were launched on 11th April 2015, at Vitality Awards Ceremony. Their genesis is based on requirements of a nation with tropical climatic conditions.
Yesteryears' heavy, hot and uncomfortable helmets were replaced with SBHT helmets that are light, comfortable and cool. 
Now the most important aspect of bike safety comes with the freedom to jump, run and flip some crazy stunts for a terrific ride.
